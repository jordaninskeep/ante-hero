White Dice = Strengths, support, and narrative momentum Black Dice = Flaws, danger, opposition, and inner demons The 40 dice represent the total amount of influence a character will have on the story. When the dice run out the characters arc comes to an end. [!NOTE] It is suggested to actually buy this many dice. Players can keep their dice in a bag or container. Otherwise, players will need to keep a tally sheet to subtract and add dice to track their amount throughout the game. Session Pools \u221e At the beginning of each session the player randomly pull 10 dice from their life pool. This is their session pool. [!NOTE] The number of dice dedicated to each session can be adjusted to shorten or length a sessions gameplay. 10 is roughly a 2 hour session. This represents the amount of influence a player can have on a session. Because the player blindly pulls the dice, a character strengths or weaknesses may play an exaggerated role in a session but will balance over the course of the game. The session pool is what the player will draw from each time they roll, except in the case of \"digging deep.\" Anteing Pots for Scenes \u221e [!WARNING] It is possible that dedicating 10 dice to a session, and then also anteing dice to a scene create a redundancy in the the \"Use it or loss it\" rule. I wonder if there is a way to avoid this happening twice. A couple thoughts: 1. The initial session pool allows for a control of how long sessions last, (though I don't think we have ever used all our dice). 2. I would like to see people rolling more dice. I think we are taking things too slow. Most rolls have been 1, 2 or 3 dice, but we should think about this more. 3. The ante is really where we want the player to \"risk it of the biscuit\". We should find a way to make this feel more significant. Once the first scene is determined and the showrunner determines the first pot, all character players will \"ante\" any number of their dice from their session pool. Count up the total number of all dice anted by all players, add 1/2 of the number rounded down to the total, and multiply by 3.5. This number is the number which when it is reached or passed, \"busts\" the scene pot. Any dice that are anted are committed towards a scene and can only be used in that scene. If they are not expended during the scene they become lost. Discard them to the lost dice pool. [!NOTE] Think of this number less as a DC in other TTRPGs and more as the amount of interest or time a player wants to spend on a particular scene. Rolling the Dice \u221e Each player then rolls all or some of their dice which was anted towards the scene. If they do not roll all of them, they may get a chance to roll a second initiative and take a second chance at a pot. Determining Initiative \u221e The player with the highest roll goes first preceding to the next highest, etc. Ties are broken first by the player who rolled the least dice, then by the player with the highest single die. If players rolled exactly the same roll, both roll a D6 and the highest roll goes first. Resolving Rolls \u221e Following the order of initiative, each player then resolves their roll narratively. Mark on the Plot Point Card the total of their roll. Determine the setting of the scene Determine what other characters are in the scene. Determine what NPCs are in the scene, and who will roleplay them. Collaboratively act out the scene.

The goal was to explore how player-created ?pots? (scene ideas or conflicts) could be turned into a collaboratively unfolding story, governed by a Storyboard (Act 1, Act 2, Act 3, etc.). The session focused on the Lunchroom Food Fight episode, experimenting with how players commit their characters to scenes through risk, improvisation, and responsive worldbuilding. \u221e Setup Phase: The Storyboard Pot Submissions: Each player submitted one or more ?pots??scenario prompts with potential conflict or narrative value. The Showrunner also added a pot. \\ Script Formation: The Showrunner curated these pots into a Storyboard , dividing them into Acts (Act 1, Act 2, Act 3), forming a loose narrative arc for the episode. \\ Scene Selection: Players then chose which scene they wanted their character to be involved in. \\ Wager System (\"Pay to Play\"): Instead of DCs, players committed to a scene by wagering dice?representing how invested or risky their character?s participation would be. This ?Pot? determines scene momentum, not success/failure. Mechanics: Adaptive Initiative: Players rolled to determine who would initiate the scene, using the dice they wagered. The highest roller begins the action?\"And... Action!\". \\ Resolution & Reactions: Scenes are resolved not by success/failure rolls, but by how the world (controlled by the Showrunner) reacts to players' actions. \\ Aspects (such as \"Fat Goth Girl\" or \"Flamboyant Student\") do not add dice?they inform behavior . \\ The World can ?bust? the pot, causing escalation or unexpected shifts. Scene Playtest: ?Lunchroom Food Fight? Characters: Beatrice , a fat goth girl (initiator) \\ Jordan , a stinky punk \\ K.C. , flamboyant student with a scarf \\ Chris , the nerd \\ Richard , the jock \\ Scene Narrative: Beatrice trips Chris the Nerd, who spills his tray onto Richard the Jock. She attempts to convince Richard that Chris did it intentionally. Richard, roleplayed by the Showrunner (as The World), is not fooled?he yells, puts on his football helmet, and suspects Beatrice. K.C. laughs and spits milk onto a nearby cheerleader. Jordan stands on the table, throws a tray, and screams ?FOOD FIGHT!??slips, and disappears into the chaos. Chris is accidentally struck in the face by the tray. World Reaction: The Pot is Busted. The Showrunner declares that chaos exceeds control. \\ The lunch ladies activate lockdown protocol: doors and windows seal. No one knows who started it. The consequences are collective. Key Takeaways from the Playtest: Narrative Control Emerges from Risk: Players influence the scene by how much they ?pay in,? not whether they win. \\ Aspects Drive Roleplay, Not Mechanics: This encourages character-forward play. \\ Scene Outcomes Reflect Story Progression: Not success/failure but narrative consequences. \\ World Reacts Like a GM-less Engine: The Showrunner embodies the World and pushes back or escalates when necessary. \\ Notes for Revision: Clarify Scene Resolution: Determine a mechanic or signal for when a scene ends (e.g., pot total met, or world bust). \\ Pot Guidelines: Offer players clearer guidelines for writing pots. \\ Reward Mechanism: Possibly develop an end-of-episode reflection or reward based on how well the characters? arcs developed or how the party evolved.","title":"Orginal 20250915"},{"location":"orginal-20250915/#dice-system-overview","text":"Set a Starting Group Project (\"Pot\"): \\ Roll 3?6 dice. \\ White highest = Smooth start Red highest = Rough start Tie = Twist or surprise Character Creation & Development Characters, or Personas , are fluid narrative tools?not fixed heroes.","title":"Dice System Overview"},{"location":"orginal-20250915/#start-with","text":"Name & Trope/Role (e.g., ?The Burned-Out Detective?) \\ Foreshadowing Line (e.g., ?One day, I?ll become what they fear??) \\ Arc Theme (e.g., Redemption through Sacrifice ) \\ (+) Ending: Peaceful resolution (?)

The Showrunner also added a pot. \\ Script Formation: The Showrunner curated these pots into a Storyboard , dividing them into Acts (Act 1, Act 2, Act 3), forming a loose narrative arc for the episode. \\ Scene Selection: Players then chose which scene they wanted their character to be involved in. \\ Wager System (\"Pay to Play\"): Instead of DCs, players committed to a scene by wagering dice?representing how invested or risky their character?s participation would be. This ?Pot? determines scene momentum, not success/failure. Mechanics: Adaptive Initiative: Players rolled to determine who would initiate the scene, using the dice they wagered. The highest roller begins the action?\"And... Action!\". \\ Resolution & Reactions: Scenes are resolved not by success/failure rolls, but by how the world (controlled by the Showrunner) reacts to players' actions. \\ Aspects (such as \"Fat Goth Girl\" or \"Flamboyant Student\") do not add dice?they inform behavior . \\ The World can ?bust? the pot, causing escalation or unexpected shifts. Scene Playtest: ?Lunchroom Food Fight? Characters: Beatrice , a fat goth girl (initiator) \\ Jordan , a stinky punk \\ K.C. , flamboyant student with a scarf \\ Chris , the nerd \\ Richard , the jock \\ Scene Narrative: Beatrice trips Chris the Nerd, who spills his tray onto Richard the Jock. She attempts to convince Richard that Chris did it intentionally. Richard, roleplayed by the Showrunner (as The World), is not fooled?he yells, puts on his football helmet, and suspects Beatrice. K.C. laughs and spits milk onto a nearby cheerleader. Jordan stands on the table, throws a tray, and screams ?FOOD FIGHT!??slips, and disappears into the chaos. Chris is accidentally struck in the face by the tray. World Reaction: The Pot is Busted. The Showrunner declares that chaos exceeds control. \\ The lunch ladies activate lockdown protocol: doors and windows seal. No one knows who started it. The consequences are collective. Key Takeaways from the Playtest: Narrative Control Emerges from Risk: Players influence the scene by how much they ?pay in,? not whether they win. \\ Aspects Drive Roleplay, Not Mechanics: This encourages character-forward play. \\ Scene Outcomes Reflect Story Progression: Not success/failure but narrative consequences. \\ World Reacts Like a GM-less Engine: The Showrunner embodies the World and pushes back or escalates when necessary. \\ Notes for Revision: Clarify Scene Resolution: Determine a mechanic or signal for when a scene ends (e.g., pot total met, or world bust). \\ Pot Guidelines: Offer players clearer guidelines for writing pots. \\ Reward Mechanism: Possibly develop an end-of-episode reflection or reward based on how well the characters? arcs developed or how the party evolved.","title":"We tested a scene-based narrative system called the Showrunner System. The goal was to explore how player-created ?pots? (scene ideas or conflicts) could be turned into a collaboratively unfolding story, governed by a Storyboard (Act 1, Act 2, Act 3, etc.). The session focused on the Lunchroom Food Fight episode, experimenting with how players commit their characters to scenes through risk, improvisation, and responsive worldbuilding."},{"location":"showrunner/","text":"The Showrunner \u221e Not a GM, a different kind of player \u221e How to be the showrunner \u221e","title":"Showrunner"},{"location":"showrunner/#the-showrunner","text":"","title":"The Showrunner"},{"location":"showrunner/#not-a-gm-a-different-kind-of-player","text":"","title":"Not a GM, a different kind of player"},{"location":"showrunner/#how-to-be-the-showrunner","text":"","title":"How to be the showrunner"}]}
