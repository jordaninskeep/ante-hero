## The Purpose

We build this game to fill a need in out gaming group. As we became more and more pressed for time, we needed a game that could allow for fun, creative gameplay and character develop within a limited timeframe. Realistically, we needed a game that would be fun to play for 2 to 2 1/5 hours, 2 to 3 times a month, without dragging on for years.
