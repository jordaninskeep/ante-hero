# Dice System Overview



- **Set a Starting Group Project** ("Pot"): \
 Roll 3?6 dice. \


- White highest = Smooth start

- Red highest = Rough start

- Tie = Twist or surprise

**Character Creation & Development**

Characters, or **Personas**, are fluid narrative tools?not fixed heroes.

### **Start With:**

- **Name & Trope/Role** (e.g., ?The Burned-Out Detective?) \


- **Foreshadowing Line** (e.g., ?One day, I?ll become what they fear??) \


- **Arc Theme** (e.g., *Redemption through Sacrifice*) \


- (+) Ending: Peaceful resolution

- (?) Ending: Self-destruction

### **Aspects & Qualities**

Each character has three **Aspects**:

- **Body**, **Mind**, and **Soul**

Each Aspect develops **Qualities**:

- **Positive (White dice):** Strengths, skills, virtues \


- **Negative (Red dice):** Flaws, trauma, habits

**Example:**

- *Body (+): Ex-Military Physique*

- *Body (?): Injured Leg*

### **Starting Pools:**

Choose one:

- **Option A:** Start blank with 10 dice (assigned as Qualities develop) \


- **Option B:** Start with 1 White & 1 Red Quality per Aspect (6 total) \


**Gameplay Structure**

### **Sessions & Seasons**

- **Episode =** 5?10 Scenes + Intermissions + ?Under the Stars? epilogue \


- **Season =** 8?12 Episodes \


- **Series =** Full campaign arc

**Scenes & Intermissions**

### **Scenes**

Narrative moments where players interact, face conflicts, and roll dice.

1. **Set the Scene: **Players write down something they want to happen that becomes a Pot. The Showrunner takes these as a ?Story Board? and arranges them as Scenes to happen in the episode and frames the setting and stakes. \


2. **Build Dice Pools:**

- Add 1 White die per relevant positive Quality

- Add 1 Red die per negative Quality or complication

- Scene Type (sets base danger level):

- Standard (7W:3R)

- Risky (5W:5R)

- Desperate (3W:7R)

- **Roll & Resolve: **Compare White vs Red outcomes. Narrate together.

**Intermissions**

Breaks between scenes to:

- Propose new storylines

- Adjust character arcs or Qualities

- Establish new **Pots** (goals, challenges) \


**Pots: Narrative Stakes**

### **What is a Pot?**

A **Pot** is a narrative challenge: a project, interaction, goal, conflict, or mission.

**Examples:**

- ?Cleanse the Shrine?

- ?Defend the Village?

- ?Uncover the Traitor?

### **Creating a Pot:**

- Players and Showrunner **ante dice** into proposed Pots. \


- The total number of dice = the Pot?s **difficulty**. \


- Only actions with enough **White influence** can ?bust? the Pot.

### **Resolving a Pot:**

- Players roll in Scenes against a Pot.

- If White influence exceeds Red (or difficulty), the Pot is **busted**. \


- **Rewards:**

- Gain or evolve a Quality (White or Red)

- Advance Arc

- Gain allies, resources, or narrative leverage

### **Loose Ends:**

- If a Pot is ignored, it becomes a **Loose End**. \


- The Showrunner may roll for **World Response** (e.g. 3 Red dice). \


- 2+ Red 6s = World busts the Pot.

- Use the **World Bust Table** (twists, setbacks, deaths, new threats). \


**Advancement**

**Busting a Pot** allows a player to:

- Add or refine a Quality (e.g., gain ?Steadfast? or ?Unstable?)

- Mark a **turning point** in their Arc \


- Receive narrative perks (e.g., a new ally)

**Capped Qualities**: ~5 per Aspect recommended

**Ego Dice (Advanced/Finale Mechanic)**

Each player has **2?3 Ego Dice** per Season:

- Represent personal reserves pushed to the limit

- Flip the die blind during a scene: it becomes a random Red or White die

- Use it to influence a crucial scene

- But beware: **using all Ego Dice may lead to character collapse** in the finale

**Initiative & Scene Framing**

**Adaptive Initiative (Optional):**

- Players ante 1?3 dice to bid for scene control

- Highest total frames the scene and begins with ?And? Action!?

**Game Summary Flow**

1. **Set Scene & Pot**

2. **Declare Actions & Build Dice Pools**

3. **Roll (White vs Red) & Interpret Result**

4. **Narrate Outcome**

5. **Intermission: Update arcs, propose next Pot or Scene**

6. **Repeat**

7. **End Episode with ?Under the Stars? scene**

**Character Sheet Elements**

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Name / Trope / Foreshadow | Character identity, archetype, and dramatic line |
| Aspects & Qualities | Body / Mind / Soul with positive (+W) and negative (+R) traits |
| Arc | Title, foreshadowing, positive and negative endings |
| Secrets & Relationships | Short dramatic hooks |
| Dice Pool | Track current dice available (White/Red) |
| Ego Dice Used | Track remaining Ego dice |

**Design Philosophy**

- Let **themes, not heroes**, take center stage. \


- Embrace **?Yes, and??** to grow the fiction cooperatively. \


- Treat every result?success or failure?as **meaningful influence**. \


- Personas change, die, or disappear; **the world remembers. \
**

- The story is not about winning?it is about transformation.

Let the **story** win. Let the **dice** decide.

**ADVANCEMENT THROUGH POTS**

You evolve your character by **busting Pots** (i.e., succeeding against the game?s stakes).

When you bust a Pot, you may:

- Add a new **Quality** (positive or negative) \


- **Deepen a Quality** (narratively evolve it: e.g., *From "Short-Tempered" ? "Rage-Induced Tunnel Vision"*) \


- Add a new **Relationship**, **Secret**, or piece of **History \
**

- Mark a **Turning Point** in your Arc (affects narrative weight and possible ending) \


- You may only hold a limited number of qualities per aspect (e.g., 5 each). After that, additions must replace or evolve older ones.

**The World Responds**

- GMs track **World Pots**: Adversarial plots, looming disasters, and unfinished business \


- World can roll against player goals

- If the World accumulates **3 World Busts**, it initiates a **Tension Phase**: \


- Rising dread

- Growing Unrest

- Conflict breaks out

- Major character/NPC dies or vanishes

**Game Flow**

1. Set the Scene

2. Declare Goals & Identify Pots

3. Build Dice Pools

4. Resolve

5. Intermission: Plan next Scene

6. ?Under the Stars? wrap-up

**Sample Scene**

A mystic tries to seal a portal before a curse spreads.

- Red Dice: 4 (time pressure, magical backlash) \


- White Dice: 3 (ritual knowledge, support from allies)

**Rolls:** Red: 6, 6, 3, 2 | White: 5, 6, 4

- Success (White 6), BUT double Red 6 = Flaw gained, and something dark escapes

**World-Scale Dice Metrics**

| Players |  Pot Total | Easy |   Medium | Hard |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3 | 165 | 40 | 50 | 75 |
| 4 | 220 | 55 | 65 | 100 |
| 5 | 280 | 70 | 85 | 125 |

### **Standard Scene Ratios**

|        Type | White:Red |
|---|---|
| Standard | 7:3 |
| Risky | 5:5 |
| Desperate | 3:7 |

**Example Scene: A warrior tries to hold a crumbling bridge.**

- **Dice Pool: 3 Red (danger, collapsing structure) + 2 White (training, strength)**

- **Rolls: Red 6, 5, 3 / White 4, 6**

- **Result: Mixed. Allies cross safely (White 6), but the warrior is injured (Red 6).**

### ***Playtest Summary:***

### We tested a scene-based narrative system called the *Showrunner System*. The goal was to explore how player-created ?pots? (scene ideas or conflicts) could be turned into a collaboratively unfolding story, governed by a Storyboard (Act 1, Act 2, Act 3, etc.). The session focused on the *Lunchroom Food Fight* episode, experimenting with how players commit their characters to scenes through risk, improvisation, and responsive worldbuilding.

**Setup Phase: The Storyboard**

- **Pot Submissions:** Each player submitted one or more ?pots??scenario prompts with potential conflict or narrative value. The Showrunner also added a pot. \


- **Script Formation:** The Showrunner curated these pots into a *Storyboard*, dividing them into Acts (Act 1, Act 2, Act 3), forming a loose narrative arc for the episode. \


- **Scene Selection:** Players then chose which scene they wanted their character to be involved in. \


- **Wager System ("Pay to Play"):** Instead of DCs, players committed to a scene by wagering dice?representing how invested or risky their character?s participation would be. This ?Pot? determines scene momentum, not success/failure.

**Mechanics:**

- **Adaptive Initiative:** Players rolled to determine who would initiate the scene, using the dice they wagered. The highest roller begins the action?"And... Action!". \


- **Resolution & Reactions:**

- Scenes are resolved not by success/failure rolls, but by how the world (controlled by the Showrunner) *reacts* to players' actions. \


- Aspects (such as "Fat Goth Girl" or "Flamboyant Student") *do not* add dice?they *inform behavior*. \


- The World can ?bust? the pot, causing escalation or unexpected shifts.

**Scene Playtest: ?Lunchroom Food Fight?**

**Characters:**

- **Beatrice**, a fat goth girl (initiator) \


- **Jordan**, a stinky punk \


- **K.C.**, flamboyant student with a scarf \


- **Chris**, the nerd \


- **Richard**, the jock \


**Scene Narrative:**

- Beatrice trips Chris the Nerd, who spills his tray onto Richard the Jock.

- She attempts to convince Richard that Chris did it intentionally.

- Richard, roleplayed by the Showrunner (as The World), is not fooled?he yells, puts on his football helmet, and suspects Beatrice.

- K.C. laughs and spits milk onto a nearby cheerleader.

- Jordan stands on the table, throws a tray, and screams ?FOOD FIGHT!??slips, and disappears into the chaos.

- Chris is accidentally struck in the face by the tray.

**World Reaction:**

- **The Pot is Busted.** The Showrunner declares that chaos exceeds control. \


- The lunch ladies activate lockdown protocol: doors and windows seal.

- No one knows who started it. The consequences are collective.

**Key Takeaways from the Playtest:**

- **Narrative Control Emerges from Risk:** Players influence the scene by how much they ?pay in,? not whether they win. \


- **Aspects Drive Roleplay, Not Mechanics:** This encourages character-forward play. \


- **Scene Outcomes Reflect Story Progression:** Not success/failure but narrative consequences. \


- **World Reacts Like a GM-less Engine:** The Showrunner embodies the World and pushes back or escalates when necessary. \


**Notes for Revision:**

- **Clarify Scene Resolution:** Determine a mechanic or signal for when a scene ends (e.g., pot total met, or world bust). \


- **Pot Guidelines:** Offer players clearer guidelines for writing pots. \


- **Reward Mechanism:** Possibly develop an end-of-episode reflection or reward based on how well the characters? arcs developed or how the party evolved.
