# Dice Mechanics

## Life Pools

Each character starts the game with a pool of 40 dice total, 20 white and 20 black.

- **White Dice** = Strengths, support, and narrative momentum  
- **Black Dice** = Flaws, danger, opposition, and inner demons  

The 40 dice represent the total influence a character will have on the story. When the dice run out the characters arc comes to an end. 

> [!NOTE]
> It is suggested to actually buy this many dice. Players can keep their dice in a bag or container.
> Otherwise, players will need to keep a tally sheet to subtract and add dice to track their amount.


## Session Pools

At the begining of each session the player randomly select 10 dice from their life pool. 

> [!NOTE]
> The number of dice dedicated to each session can be adjusted to shorten or length a sessions gameplay. 



This represents the amount of influence a player can have on a session. The random element means that a chacter strengths or weaknesses may play an exaggerated role in a session but will balance over the course of the game.

The session pool is what the player will draw from each time they roll, except in the case of "digging deep." 

## Anteing Pots for Scenes 

Once the first scene is determined and the showrunner determines the first pot, all character players will "ante" any number of their dice from their session pool. Count up the tota number of all dice anted by all players, add 1/2 of the number rounded down to the total, and multiply by 3.5. 

This number is the number which when it is reached or passed, "busts" the scene pot. 

Any dice that are anted committed towards a scene are now dedicated to that scene only. If they are not rolled during the scene they become lost. Discard them to the lost dice pool. 

> [!NOTE]
> Think of this number less as a DC in other TTRPGs and more as the amount of interest or time a player wants to spend on a particular scene. 

## Rolling the Dice

Each player then rolls all or some of their dice which was anted towards the scene. If they do not roll all of them, they may get a chance to roll a second initiative and take a second chance at the scene. 

### Determining Initiative

The player with the highest roll goes first preceding to the next highest, etc.

Ties are broken first by the player who rolled the least dice, then by the player with the highest single die. If players rolled exactly the same roll, both roll a D6 and highest wins.

### Resolving Rolls

Following the order of initiative, each player then resolves their roll narratively. Mark on the Plot Point Card the total of their roll. 

1. Determine the setting of the scene
2. Determine what other characters are in the scene.
3. Determine what NPCs are in the scene, and who will roleplay them. 
4. Collaboratively act out the scene.
5. 

**Dice Results (per die):**

- 1?3 = No Influence

- 4?5 = Some Influence

- 6 = Dominant Influence

- Two or more 6s = Overwhelming Influence

### **Outcome Comparison:**

| White vs Red | Narrative Outcome |
|---|---|
| White > Red | Triumph ? intent succeeds; complications may arise |
| White = Red | Mixed ? goal succeeds, but at a cost |
| Red > White | Trouble ? intent fails; new problems emerge |

**Game Flow**

### **1. World-Building (Session 0)**

1. Fantasy?
2. Sci-Fi?
3. Post-Apocalyptic
4. Horror?
5. Historical?
6. Urban Fantasy

- **Conditions & Locations: \
