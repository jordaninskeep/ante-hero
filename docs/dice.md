# Dice Mechanics

## Player Pools

Each players starts with a pool of 40 dice total, 20 white and 20 black.

- **White Dice** = Strengths, support, and narrative momentum  
- **Red Dice** = Flaws, danger, opposition, and inner demons  

The 40 dice represent the total influence a character will have on the story. When the dice run out the characters arc comes to an end. 

## Session Pools

At the begining of each session the player randomly select 10 dice from their pool. 

**Dice Results (per die):**

- 1?3 = No Influence

- 4?5 = Some Influence

- 6 = Dominant Influence

- Two or more 6s = Overwhelming Influence

### **Outcome Comparison:**

| White vs Red | Narrative Outcome |
|---|---|
| White > Red | Triumph ? intent succeeds; complications may arise |
| White = Red | Mixed ? goal succeeds, but at a cost |
| Red > White | Trouble ? intent fails; new problems emerge |
