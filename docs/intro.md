## **Core Concept**

*Ante-Hero* is a collaborative, narrative-first, GM-lite roleplaying game. 

Players and [the Showrunner](showrunner.md) (GM) create a serialized story across [Episodes](game-structure.md#episodes), driven by character choices, dramatic consequences, and narrative momentum.

Rather than asking ?Did I succeed?? players roll to answer:

 **How strongly did I influence the story?**

Success, failure, and flaws all fuel the unfolding tale.
